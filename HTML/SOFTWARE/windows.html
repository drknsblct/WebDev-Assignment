                        Windows OS, computer operating system (OS) developed by Microsoft Corporation to run personal
                        computers (PCs). Featuring the first graphical user interface (GUI) for IBM-compatible PCs, the
                        Windows OS soon dominated the PC market. Approximately 90 percent of PCs run some version of
                        Windows. Microsoft Windows, commonly referred to as Windows, is a group of
                        several proprietary graphical operating system families, all of which are developed and marketed
                        by Microsoft. Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry. Active Microsoft
                        Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT; these may encompass subfamilies,
                        e.g. Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact (Windows CE). Defunct Microsoft Windows families
                        include Windows 9x, Windows Mobile and Windows Phone.

                        <h1>History</h1>
                        The first version of Windows, released in 1985, was simply a GUI offered as an extension of
                        Microsoft’s existing disk operating system, or MS-DOS. Based in part on licensed concepts
                        that Apple Inc. had used for its Macintosh System Software, Windows for the first time allowed
                        DOS users to visually navigate a virtual desktop, opening graphical “windows” displaying the
                        contents of electronic folders and files with the click of a mouse button, rather than typing
                        commands and directory paths at a text prompt. Subsequent versions introduced greater
                        functionality, including native Windows File Manager, Program Manager, and Print Manager
                        programs, and a more dynamic interface. Microsoft also developed specialized Windows packages,
                        including the networkable Windows for Workgroups and the high-powered Windows NT, aimed at
                        businesses.

                        <div id="hidden">
                            The 1995 consumer release Windows 95 fully integrated Windows and DOS and offered
                            built-in Internet support, including the World Wide Web browser Internet Explorer.With the
                            2001
                            release of Windows XP, Microsoft united its various Windows packages under a single banner,
                            offering multiple editions for consumers, businesses, multimedia developers, and others.
                            Windows
                            XP abandoned the long-used Windows 95 kernel (core software code) for a more powerful code
                            base
                            and offered a more practical interface and improved application and memory management. The
                            highly successful XP standard was succeeded in late 2006 by Windows Vista, which experienced
                            a
                            troubled rollout and met with considerable marketplace resistance, quickly acquiring a
                            reputation for being a large, slow, and resource-consuming system. Responding to Vista’s
                            disappointing adoption rate, Microsoft in 2009 released Windows 7, an OS whose interface was
                            similar to that of Vista but was met with enthusiasm for its noticeable speed improvement
                            and
                            its modest system requirements.

                            MS-DOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System) is an operating system for x86-based personal
                            computers mostly developed by Microsoft. Collectively, MS-DOS, its rebranding as IBM PC DOS,
                            and
                            some operating systems attempting to be compatible with MS-DOS, are sometimes referred to as
                            "DOS" (which is also the generic acronym for disk operating system). MS-DOS was the main
                            operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s, from which point
                            it
                            was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface (GUI), in
                            various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system.
                            IBM licensed and re-released it in 1981, as PC DOS 1.0 for use in its PCs. Although MS-DOS
                            and
                            PC DOS were initially developed in parallel by Microsoft and IBM, the two products diverged
                            after twelve years, in 1993, with recognizable differences in compatibility, syntax, and
                            capabilities.

                        During its lifetime, several competing products were released for the x86 platform, and MS-DOS
                        went through eight versions, until development ceased in 2000. Initially, MS-DOS was targeted
                        at Intel 8086 processors running on computer hardware using floppy disks to store and access not
                        only the operating system, but application software and user data as well. Progressive version
                        releases delivered support for other mass storage media in ever greater sizes and formats, along
                        with added feature support for newer processors and rapidly evolving computer architectures.
                        It was also the underlying basic operating system on which
                        early versions of Windows ran as a GUI.

                        <h1>Windows 1.0</h1>
                        <p>This is where it all started for Windows. The original Windows 1 was released in November
                            1985 and was Microsoft’s first true attempt at a graphical user interface in 16-bit.
                            Development was spearheaded by Microsoft founder Bill Gates and ran on top of MS-DOS, which
                            relied on command-line input.
                            It was notable because it relied heavily on use of a mouse before the mouse was a common
                            computer input device. To help users become familiar with this odd input system, Microsoft
                            included a game, Reversi (visible in the screenshot) that relied on mouse control, not the
                            keyboard, to get people used to moving the mouse around and clicking onscreen elements.

                        <p>Two years after the release of Windows 1, Microsoft’s Windows 2 replaced it in December 1987.
                            The big innovation for Windows 2 was that windows could overlap each other, and it also
                            introduced the ability to minimise or maximise windows instead of “iconising” or “zooming”.
                            The control panel, where various system settings and configuration options were collected
                            together in one place, was introduced in Windows 2 and survives to this day.
                            Microsoft Word and Excel also made their first appearances running on Windows 2.

                        <p>The first Windows that required a hard drive launched in 1990. Windows 3 was the first
                            version to see more widespread success and be considered a challenger to Apple’s Macintosh
                            and the Commodore Amiga graphical user interfaces, coming pre-installed on computers from
                            PC-compatible manufacturers including Zenith Data Systems.
                            Windows 3 introduced the ability to run MS-DOS programmes in windows, which brought
                            multitasking to legacy programmes, and supported 256 colours bringing a more modern,
                            colourful look to the interface.
                            More important - at least to the sum total of human time wasted - it introduced the
                            card-moving timesink (and mouse use trainer) Solitaire.

                            Start button and Start menu
                            It also introduced the concept of “plug and play” – connect a peripheral and the operating
                            system finds the appropriate drivers for it and makes it work. That was the idea; it didn’t
                            always work in practice.
                            Windows 95 also introduced a 32-bit environment, the task bar and focused on multitasking.
                            MS-DOS still played an important role for Windows 95, which required it to run some
                            programmes and elements.
                            Internet Explorer also made its debut on Windows 95, but was not installed by default
                            requiring the Windows 95 Plus! pack. Later revisions of Windows 95 included IE by default,
                            as Netscape Navigator and NCSA Mosaic were popular at the time.

                        <h1>Windows 98</h1>
                        <p>Released in June 1998, Windows 98 built on Windows 95 and brought with it IE 4, Outlook
                            Express, Windows Address Book, Microsoft Chat and NetShow Player, which was replaced by
                            Windows Media Player 6.2 in Windows 98 Second Edition in 1999.

                            Windows 98 introduced the back and forward navigation buttons and the address bar in Windows
                            Explorer, among other things. One of the biggest changes was the introduction of the Windows
                            Driver Model for computer components and accessories – one driver to support all future
                            versions of Windows.

                        <p>Windows 2000 was released in February 2000 and was based on Microsoft’s business-orientated
                            system Windows NT and later became the basis for Windows XP.
                            Microsoft’s automatic updating played an important role in Windows 2000 and became the first
                            Windows to support hibernation.

                        <h1>Windows XP</h1>
                        <p>Arguably one of the best Windows versions, Windows XP was released in October 2001 and
                            brought Microsoft’s enterprise line and consumer line of operating systems under one roof.
                            It was based on Windows NT like Windows 2000, but brought the consumer-friendly elements
                            from Windows ME. The Start menu and task bar got a visual overhaul, bringing the familiar
                            green Start button, blue task bar and vista wallpaper, along with various shadow and other
                            visual effects.

                            and security. Its development, under the codename “Longhorn”, was troubled, with ambitious
                            elements abandoned in order to get it into production.

                            October 2009. It was intended to fix all the problems and criticism faced by Vista, with
                            slight tweaks to its appearance and a concentration on user-friendly features and less
                            “dialogue box overload”.

                        <p>Released in October 2012, Windows 8 was Microsoft’s most radical overhaul of the Windows
                            interface, ditching the Start button and Start menu in favour of a more touch-friendly Start
                            screen. Windows 8 was faster than previous versions of Windows and included support for the
                            new, much faster USB 3.0 devices. The Windows Store, which offers universal Windows apps
                            that run in a full-screen mode only, was introduced.

                            users to try. The “technical preview” is very much still a work in progress.
                            Windows 10 represents another step in Microsoft’s U-turn, bringing back the Start menu and
                            more balance to traditional desktop computer users.
