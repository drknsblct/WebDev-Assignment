                        Mac OS, operating system (OS) developed by the American computer company Apple Inc. The OS was
                        introduced in 1984 to run the company’s Macintosh line of personal computers (PCs). The
                        Macintosh heralded the era of graphical user interface (GUI) systems, and it inspired Microsoft
                        Corporation to develop its own GUI, the WindowsOS.

                        <h1>Macintosh</h1>
                        Apple’s marketing for the introduction of the Macintosh focused heavily on its operating
                        system’s intuitive ease of use. Unlike virtually all other contemporary PCs, the Mac OS
                        (initially designated simply System Software, with a version number appended) was graphically
                        based. Rather than typing commands and directory paths at text prompts, users moved
                        a mouse pointer to visually navigate the Finder—a series of virtual folders and files,
                        represented by icons. Most computer operating systems eventually adopted the GUI model. In the
                        1980s Apple made an agreement allowing Microsoft to use certain aspects of the Mac interface in
                        early versions of Windows. However, except for a brief period in the 1990s, Mac OS has never
                        been licensed for use with computers made by manufacturers other than Apple.

                        <h1>OS X</h1>
                        Later Mac OS releases introduced features such as Internet file sharing, network browsing, and
                        multiple user accounts. In 1996 Apple acquired rival NeXT Computers, which was founded by Steven
                        Jobs after his departure from Apple, and in 2001 the company rolled out Mac OS X, a major
                        redesign based on both the NextStep system and Apple’s most recent OS release. OS X ran on
                        a UNIX kernel (core software code) and offered technical advances such as memory protection and
                        preemptive multitasking, along with a more versatile Finder, an elegant-looking interface called
                        Aqua, and a convenient graphical “Dock” bar for launching frequently used applications. Updates
                        to OS X added features such as automated backups and a “Dashboard” manager for small, handy
                        applications called widgets.

                        <h1>Onwards</h1>
                        From 2007 Apple unveiled a number of mobile devices that could access the Internet, including
                        the iPhone smartphone and the iPad tablet computer. Apple soon emphasized the ability of OS X to
                        connect with these devices. In 2011 Apple introduced iCloud, a cloud computing service that
                        allowed users to share data among all of their Apple devices, for both OS X and the mobile
                        operating system iOS. Apple added more features allowing connectivity between devices to
                        successive updates of OS X, iOS, and later watchOS (the operating system for the Apple
                        Watch smartwatch). These features included the ability to receive phone calls (made to the
                        iPhone) and the means of quickly sharing data (such as photos and text) among devices.

                            of its launch, mostly from independent developers. While many critics suggested
                            that the
                            operating system was not ready for mainstream adoption, they recognized the

                            of
                            its initial launch as a base on which to improve. Simply releasing Mac OS X was

                            by
                            the Macintosh community as a great accomplishment, for attempts to completely

                            fixes, kernel panics became much less frequent.

                            functioned identically on the PowerPC-based Macs and the new Intel-based

                            the

                        <h1>Leopard</h1>
                        <p>It was called by Apple "the largest update of Mac OS X". Leopard supports
                            both PowerPC-
                            and Intel x86-based Macintosh computers; support for the G3 processor was
                            dropped and
                            the G4
                            processor required a minimum clock rate of 867 MHz, and at least 512 MB
                            of RAM to be
                            installed. The single DVD works for all supported Macs (including 64-bit
                            machines). New
                            features include a new look, an updated Finder, Time Machine, Spaces, Boot
                            Camp pre-installed, full support for 64-bit applications (including graphical
                            applications),
                            new features in Mail and iChat, and a number of new security features. Leopard
                            is
                            an Open
                            Brand UNIX 03 registered product on the Intel platform. It was also the
                            first BSD-based OS
                            to receive UNIX 03 certification. Leopard dropped support for the Classic
                            Environment and
                            all Classic applications, and was the final version of Mac OS X to support the
                            PowerPC
                            architecture.

                        <p>It was the last version to be available on disc. Rather than delivering big

                            the
                            development of Snow Leopard was deliberately focused on "under the hood"
                            changes,
                            increasing

                            most
                            noticeable changes are these: the disk space that the operating system frees up
                            after a
                            clean installation compared to Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, a more
                            responsive Finder rewritten
                            in Cocoa, faster Time Machine backups, more reliable and user friendly disk

                            browser. An
                            update introduced support for the Mac App Store, Apple's digital distribution

                            for
                            macOS applications and subsequent macOS upgrades. Snow Leopard only supports

                            with

                            release removed Rosetta, making it incapable of running PowerPC applications. It
                            dropped
                            support for 32-bit Intel processors and requires 2GB of memory. Changes made to
