								<h4 style="text-align:justify">The Model 5100 is IBM's first minicomputer, i.e. not a mainframe, and is also considered one of the world's first portable computers. Although at 55-pounds, the 5100 might best be described as "self-contained" rather than "portable". There were very few other computers available at the time, and nothing even close to the capabilities of the 5100. It is a very complete system - with a keyboard, built-in data storage, and a full-screen display. It was specifically designed for professional and scientific problem-solvers, not business users or hobbyists.<br><br>
								However it could would not remain on the top of the leaderboards for long since a few years later, Apple released the synonymous Apple II, Apple 1's successor. With new features such as a color display, eight internal expansion slots and a case with a keyboard propelled it to becoming one of the most popular computers ever, despite having the same processor and running at the same speed as it's predecessor.<br><br>
								Despite releasing in the same year as the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, the Commodore 64 outclassed its competitor by a mile, selling nearly 17 million pieces worldwide and earning its place in the Guinness Book of World Records as the bestselling PC of all time, a record it holds even to this very day.<br><br>
								In 1984, the Apple Macintosh was released, and with it a new age of computing was unveiled to the public. Before the Macintosh, all computers were 'text-based' - you operated them by typing words onto the keyboard. The Macintosh was run by activating pictures (icons) on the screen with a small hand-operated device called a "mouse". Most modern-day computers now operate on this principle, including modern Apple computers and most others which run the Microsoft Windows operating system. Except for the very expensive and unpopular Apple Lisa which came out in 1983, the Macintosh is considered to be the first commercially successful computer to use a GUI (Graphical User Interface).<br><br>
								From 1985 and onwards, the fight for PC supremacy was mainly fought between the Apple, IBM and Amiga lines of personal computers. Each subsequent release of an Amiga machine built upon the already very solid base, adding more and more features to it's already impressive reservoire. By 1994 and the release of the final Amiga machine, the Amiga 4000, the computer boasted a 32-bit Motorola 68040 central processor running at 25MHz and an AGA graphics processor capable of 256 colors from a pallete of 16.7 million at 800x600 resolution among other things.<br><br>
								Announced in May 1998 and shipped in August, the iMac was Apple's computer for the new millennium. Aimed at the low-end consumer market and designed with the internet in mind, the iMac was positioned by Apple as the most original new computer since the original Mac in 1984, and came in a stylish new case design, with translucent "Bondi Blue" plastics. The iMac included a 4 Mbps IrDA port, and an internal 56Kpbs modem (a 33.6 kbps modem was originally announced in May, but was upped to 56 kbps at MacWorld.), used two 12 Mbps Universal Serial Ports (USB) as its only means of external expansion, and included a newly-designed USB keyboard and mouse. While it had no other serial or SCSI ports, many manufacturers promised to make a variety of USB peripherals available by the time it shipped in August, and by and large they delivered on that promise. A "Rev B." model was released several months later, with 6 MB of VRAM, and several hardware bug-fixes. The iMac sold for $1,299. This Rev. B iMac was replaced by the Rev. C in January 1999.<br><br>
								Throughout the 2000s, ready made PC selling fell off in favor of custom-made PCs, built piece-by-piece by amateur and professional technicians. Whilst others faded, however, one PC line remained strong, continuously selling millions of units along the years and with every new release, the Apple Macintosh.<br><br>
								Towards the end of the 2000s and the start of the next decade, major companies of the industry changed focus from the previously dominant, powerful but large systems, to smaller, smarter and faster mobile devices. Those that predicted the the trend early found themselves in a very good position to take advantage of the growing demand for stronger portable devices.
